<h1>Active Directory Home Lab</h1>


<h2>Intro</h2>
I have been interested in Microsoft's Active Direct service for sometime. Just a few days ago, I found myself on Youtube watching a 30 minute tutorial by Andy Malone on it's workings (great video by the way. You can check it out [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85-bp7XxWDQ). Since then, I decided I would look into setting up a lab on my own personal computer and test out a few features. I learned a good deal in the process and had some hands on experiencing configuring DHCP Scope and seeing it work as the client computer recieved an IP address from the DC which was a huge plus. Let's get into it!
